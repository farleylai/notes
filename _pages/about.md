**Farley Lai** is a researcher in the Machine Learning department at the NEC Laboratories America.
His current research focuses on video understanding and reasoning in retail.
Previous research projects involves defect detection for manufacturing, visual entailment tasks for multi-modal reasoning between images and text 
as well as state of the art language grounding.
He received his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Octav Chipara in Computer Science at the University of Iowa.
High performance stream processing to model the runtime behavior and improve resource efficiency of stream applications through compile-time analysis serves as his research foundation.
His M.S. was completed with thesis on distributed mutual exclusion and scheduling fairness at the National Central University in Taiwan.
Before pursuing a Ph.D., he had been working in the surveillance industry and led a project of developing video management software.
