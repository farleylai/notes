A dedicated &lt;username&gt;.github.io repo is no longer necessary. . Editing on Google/Colab with Access to GPU/TPU . Each post can be either in Jupyter notebook or markdown. If in Jupyter notebook, the editing and running are well integrated with Google/Colab, implying interactive computation with access to GPU/TPU for free as follows. . import torch !nvidia-smi print(f&quot;torch.cuda.device_count(): {torch.cuda.device_count()}&quot;) .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
